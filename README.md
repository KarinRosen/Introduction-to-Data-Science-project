# Introduction-to-Data-Science-project
Our project consist of a lot of datasets and notebooks, as different parameter analysis is done in different notebooks to avoid reassigning the same variables over again. 

The most important files are: 

Folder "Kaardi materjalid" and notebook "KAART" - contains files necessary for the geospatial data analysis (requires pip install geopandas)
  
Notebooks:
  - "Abielud, mis on lahutatud" - works with both marriage and divorce data, analyses their change in time and how they are correlated
  - "Kes kellega lahutanud"- Heatmap about the age groups of men and women in a divorce.

  - "sots"- A brief analyze about what is the percent of divorced man and woman, who are jobless.
  
  - "kuude_kaupa"- Line plot about how much divorces are monthly over the years and their mean.
  - "Lahutaja profiil"- Plots and tables about the month of divorce, marriage duration, number of children and age group. 
  - "Esmas- ja korduvlahutajad" - Table about the proportion of first and multiple time divorcees.
  - "Lahutuste abielude mediaanpikkuste muutumine ajas" - Line plot about how much median value of divorced couple's marriage length is changed over the years.
