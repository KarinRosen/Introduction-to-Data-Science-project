# Introduction-to-Data-Science-project
Our project consist of a lot of datasets and notebooks, as different parameter analysis is done in different notebooks to avoid reassigning the same variables over again. 

The most important files are: 
  Folder "Kaardi materjalid" and notebook "KAART" - contains files necessary for the geospatial data analysis (requires pip install geopandas)
  Notebook "Abielud, mis on lahutatud" - works with both marriage and divorce data, analyses their change in time and how they are correlated
